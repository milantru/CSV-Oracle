# Dataset Notes: Population Movement and Demographics (Rostock, 2023)

## Dataset Overview
The dataset provides population statistics for the city of Rostock in 2023, divided by city areas. It covers overall population changes (absolute and relative) and gender-specific population counts and percentages. The data includes metrics on population growth or decline per area, and the distribution of male and female residents. The context is demographic and urban statistics for monitoring population structure and movement in Rostock, based on data from the city's population register.

## Tables
- **bevoelkerungsstruktur_2023_bewegung_gesamt.csv**: Represents population movement data for different areas within Rostock in 2023. It includes metrics on absolute and relative population changes, as well as change per 1,000 residents, indicating areas with growth or decline. This data is from the demographic and urban statistics domain, specifically for tracking overall population dynamics in Rostock.
    - **Entity Represented**: Each row represents a city area within Rostock and its population change metrics for 2023.
    - **Column: stadtbereich_code**: A unique code representing each city area within Rostock.
    - **Column: stadtbereich_bezeichnung**: The name or designation of each city area within Rostock.
    - **Column: abs_bestandsveraenderung**: The absolute population change in each city area within Rostock for 2023. This can be visualized to show the overall increase or decrease in population.
    - **Column: bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000**: The population change per 1,000 residents in each city area within Rostock for 2023. The column bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000 represents the population change per 1,000 residents, offering a standardized view of population dynamics that can be compared across districts, regardless of their total population size.
    - **Column: rel_bestandsveraenderung**: The relative population change in each city area within Rostock for 2023, expressed as a percentage of the initial population. It represents the relative change in population, showing the percentage change in the population over time. It can be visualized to indicate the growth rate or decline rate of the population in each district.
    - **Correlation between abs_bestandsveraenderung and bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000**: The column abs_bestandsveraenderung is correlated with bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000 because both measure population change in each area: abs_bestandsveraenderung gives the total change, while bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000 standardizes this change per 1,000 residents, so areas with higher absolute changes tend to show similar trends per 1,000 residents.
    - **Correlation between abs_bestandsveraenderung and rel_bestandsveraenderung**: The column abs_bestandsveraenderung is correlated with rel_bestandsveraenderung because both represent population change; abs_bestandsveraenderung shows the total change, while rel_bestandsveraenderung expresses that change as a percentage of the initial population. Larger absolute changes typically result in similar relative changes, leading to a strong correlation.
    - **Correlation between rel_bestandsveraenderung and abs_bestandsveraenderung**: The column rel_bestandsveraenderung is correlated with abs_bestandsveraenderung because both reflect population change; rel_bestandsveraenderung represents the percentage change, while abs_bestandsveraenderung shows the total change. Larger absolute population changes generally lead to proportionally similar relative changes, creating a strong correlation.
    - **Correlation between rel_bestandsveraenderung and bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000**: The column rel_bestandsveraenderung is highly correlated with bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000 because both measure population change, with rel_bestandsveraenderung as a percentage and bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000 as the change per 1,000 residents. Since both metrics scale population change similarly, they show nearly identical patterns, resulting in a very high correlation.
    - **Correlation between bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000 and abs_bestandsveraenderung**: The column bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000 is correlated with abs_bestandsveraenderung because both represent population change, with bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000 standardizing the change per 1,000 residents and abs_bestandsveraenderung showing the total change. Larger total changes tend to correspond with larger changes per 1,000 residents, leading to a strong correlation.
    - **Correlation between bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000 and rel_bestandsveraenderung**: The column bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000 is highly correlated with rel_bestandsveraenderung because both measure population change, with bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000 expressing it per 1,000 residents and rel_bestandsveraenderung as a percentage of the total population. Since both metrics scale the same underlying population change, they show nearly identical trends, resulting in a very high correlation.
- **bevoelkerungsstruktur_2023_geschlecht.csv**: The table contains demographic data for Rostock in 2023, specifically detailing the male and female population counts and their respective percentages for each city area. It comes from population register data for the city, providing insights into the gender distribution across different districts.
    - **Entity Represented**: The table row represents a city district (stadtbereich) in Rostock, detailing the male and female population counts and percentages.
    - **Column: stadtbereich_code**: A unique code representing each city district (stadtbereich) in Rostock.
    - **Column: stadtbereich_bezeichnung**: The name of the city district (stadtbereich) in Rostock.
    - **Column: anzahl_maennlich**: The number of male residents in each city district (stadtbereich) in Rostock. This can be compared with the number of female residents (anzahl_weiblich) to analyze the gender distribution in each district.
    - **Correlation between anzahl_maennlich and anzahl_weiblich**: The column anzahl_maennlich is highly correlated with anzahl_weiblich because both represent the population counts of different genders in the same city district, and these counts tend to be closely related. A higher male population usually corresponds to a higher female population in the same district, leading to a strong correlation.
    - **Column: anteil_maennlich**: The percentage of male residents in each city district (stadtbereich) in Rostock.
    - **Column: anzahl_weiblich**: The number of female residents in each city district (stadtbereich) in Rostock. This can be compared with the number of male residents (anzahl_maennlich) to analyze the gender distribution in each district.
    - **Correlation between anzahl_weiblich and anzahl_maennlich**: The column anzahl_weiblich is highly correlated with anzahl_maennlich because both represent the total population in each city district, separated by gender. As the total population increases or decreases, both male and female populations typically change in a similar proportion, leading to a high correlation.
    - **Column: anteil_weiblich**: The column anteil_weiblich represents the percentage of the female population in each city district relative to the total population.

## User View
- **Visualization of Population Movement**: You can use this dataset to visualize population movement in Rostock by plotting the population changes over time across different city districts. The columns detailing population changes (such as abs_bestandsveraenderung, rel_bestandsveraenderung, and bestandsveraaenderung_je_1000) can be visualized to show both absolute and relative changes in population, as well as per-thousand changes. You can also compare population distribution between male and female residents using the anzahl_maennlich and anzahl_weiblich columns. A combination of bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps could be effective for representing these dynamics.
